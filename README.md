# Hidden Markov Model in C++ (from scratch)

An implementation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in C++ from scratch, as part of a machine learning course.
Includes experiments on English text and substitution cipher breaking.

# Features

- Discrete Hidden Markov Model implemented in modern C++
- Forward & Backward algorithms
- Viterbi decoding for most likely state sequence
- Baumâ€“Welch re-estimation for training
- Config-driven experiments (N = 2, 3, 4, 27 states and cipher text cracking)
